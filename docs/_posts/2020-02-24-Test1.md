First Test Blog Entry
======================

## Section 1
Hello World![^1]

## Section 2
Oh, wow! Such blog!

With code:
```javascript
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;


contract MinimalVoting { /* The contract's name */
  mapping(uint => uint) public votes; /* A map which relates a voting number to the amount of its votes 
		uint is a datatype for unsigned integers (only positive integers) */
  uint public max; /* limits the number of possible voting numbers */
  bool public panic = false; /* panic switch, which stops voting if a number received the maximum amount of votes by reaching the maximum of an integer */

  constructor(uint _max) public { /* constructor will be called when the contract is created */
    max = _max; /* saves the _max parameter to the storage */
  }
 }
```
## And a Formula
$1 + 1 = 2$
